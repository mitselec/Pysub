How to use:

- Find a video of your preference that has subtitles and copy the url

- Open the distributable exe or run the python script

- Paste the link into the prompt and choose the subtitle that you want to download

- The subtitle is going to be saved into your working directory or the executable's folder as "subtitle.srt". You can rename it if you want to, I haven't managed to implement that into the code yet.

- Enjoy!
